> **Building tools that amplify how humans work with AI.**

## The Story

There's a lie we tell Product Managers: *"You need to learn to code to be technical."*

I spent years believing this. Python tutorials abandoned. JavaScript courses forgotten. Feeling like an imposter in engineering meetings. The gap between "PM who writes specs" and "PM who builds things" felt impossible.

Then AI changed everything.

With tools like Claude Code, I realized: you don't need to memorize syntax. You need to **think in systems, break down problems clearly, and know what's possible**. The AI handles the rest.

So I did something I never thought I could. **I built tools.**

Not just one. A whole operating system for how I work.

---

## What I Do

**Day job:** Product Manager navigating complex systems and stakeholder alignment.

**Night job:** Building frameworks and tools that make AI actually useful — not just impressive demos, but daily drivers.

I sit at the intersection of **product thinking** and **system building**. I believe the future belongs to people who can do both.

## How vibeOS Was Born

After hundreds of hours building with AI, I noticed patterns:

**What didn't work:**
- Prompting into the void — no structure, no memory
- Starting with solutions before understanding problems
- Context lost every session, starting from scratch
- Generic AI responses that missed MY way of thinking

**What worked:**
- Writing down my principles so AI could reference them
- Creating workflows that guided AI step-by-step
- Building context that compounds over time
- Making AI an extension of MY cognition, not a generic assistant

So I extracted everything into a framework. Then I refined it. Then I open-sourced it.

**vibeOS** is what emerged — not a tool, but an operating system for AI-augmented work.

## Core Beliefs

These principles guide everything I build:

### 1. Problem-First, Always
Never start with solutions. Understand the problem so deeply that the solution becomes obvious.
- Ask "what problem are we solving?" before any work
- Root cause > symptoms
- Challenge assumed constraints vs real constraints

### 2. Simplicity as Destination
Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. Accept complexity during exploration, compress toward simplicity in final form.
- Start messy, ship clean
- If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet
- Remove until it breaks, add back one thing

### 3. Systems Over Goals
Goals are endpoints. Systems are engines. Optimize for repeatable processes that compound.
- Build pipelines, not one-off solutions
- Automate the repeatable, focus on the creative
- Every manual task is a system waiting to be born

### 4. Leverage Through AI
You're not competing with AI — you're multiplying through it. Your edge is taste, judgment, and context.
- Context engineering > prompt engineering
- AI handles execution, you handle direction
- Orchestration > implementation

### 5. Ship and Iterate
Perfection is the enemy of progress. Feedback loops beat isolation.
- 80% shipped beats 100% planned
- Learn in production, not in theory
- Speed creates learning

## Mental Models I Use

| Model | How I Apply It |
|-------|----------------|
| **Inversion** | What would guarantee failure? Avoid that. |
| **Second-order thinking** | Then what? And then what? |
| **Map ≠ Territory** | Models are useful lies. Don't confuse with reality. |
| **Leverage points** | Small inputs, large outputs. Find the fulcrum. |
| **Skin in the game** | Only advise what I'd do myself. |

## Active Projects

### 🌊 [vibeOS](https://github.com/kv0906/vibeos)
> Turn your AI coding tool into a workspace, knowledge hub, and build engine.

The operating system I use daily. Open-sourced so others can build on it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kv0906/vibeos.git
# Then just say: "vibeOS — I want to build [your idea]"
```

**What it does:**
- Gives AI your principles and thinking patterns
- Guides projects from problem → shipped product
- Keeps context across sessions
- Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, any AI that reads files

### 🛠️ [PM-Kit](https://github.com/kv0906/pm-kit)
> Systematic product management in your terminal.

20 commands that turn hours of PM work into minutes.

```bash
/plugin install kv0906/pm-kit
```

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/prd` | Generate comprehensive PRDs |
| `/northstar` | Transform ideas into North Star framework |
| `/prioritize` | Apply RICE, ICE, or Kano frameworks |
| `/research` | Multi-source research synthesis |
| `/consensus` | Build stakeholder alignment systematically |

## The Philosophy

> *"AI should be an extension of YOUR cognition, not a generic assistant."*

Most people use AI like a search engine with attitude. Ask question, get answer, forget context, repeat.

I use AI like a **cognitive extension**:
- It knows my principles
- It follows my workflows
- It remembers my context
- It thinks like I would think

The difference isn't the AI. It's the system around it.

---

## The Vision

I'm building toward a future where:

1. **"Technical PM" is the default**, not the exception
2. **Context engineering > prompt engineering** — systems beat one-off prompts
3. **Everyone can build tools**, not just engineers
4. **AI augments human thinking**, not just automates tasks

---

## Why Open Source?

Because the best tools are built in public.

Because I learned everything from people who shared freely.

Because I want to see what others build with these ideas.

## Connect

If you're exploring AI-augmented workflows:

- ⭐ Star [vibeOS](https://github.com/kv0906/vibeos) or [PM-Kit](https://github.com/kv0906/pm-kit) if useful
- 💬 Open an issue with feedback
- 🤝 DM me with your experiments

The gap between "person with ideas" and "person who builds" is closing. Let's close it together.
