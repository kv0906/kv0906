# Why I Built PM-Kit

There's a lie we tell Product Managers: *"You need to learn to code to be technical."*

I spent years believing this. I'd start Python tutorials, abandon them. Try JavaScript, give up. Feel like an imposter in engineering meetings. The gap between "PM who writes specs" and "PM who builds things" felt insurmountable.

Then I discovered something that changed everything: **AI doesn't just help you code. It lets you BUILD.**

With tools like Claude Code, I realized the definition of "technical PM" was shifting. You don't need to memorize syntax or debug memory leaks. You need to:
- Think in systems
- Break down problems clearly
- Know what's possible

The AI handles the rest.

So I did something I never thought I could do. **I built a tool.**

## The Tool: PM-Kit

**PM-Kit** is a Claude Code plugin that brings systematic product management directly into your terminal. It's proof that PMs can build real, useful software.

```
/plugin install kv0906/pm-kit
```

### What It Does

| Hours of Work | Becomes |
|---------------|---------|
| Writing PRDs from scratch | `/prd` in minutes |
| Scattered research notes | `/research` synthesized |
| Gut-feel prioritization | `/prioritize` with RICE, ICE, Kano |
| Endless stakeholder debates | `/consensus` with structure |
| Vague product ideas | `/northstar` → clear vision |

### By The Numbers

```
20 Commands  ·  15 AI Agents  ·  Long Chain-of-Thought Methodology
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Every command executes 15+ systematic reasoning steps
with verification checkpoints and quality gates.
```

### Featured Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/prd` | Generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents |
| `/northstar` | Transform raw ideas into North Star framework |
| `/prioritize` | Apply RICE, ICE, or Kano frameworks to backlogs |
| `/today` | Get personalized daily work suggestions |
| `/retro` | Turn meeting notes into structured retrospectives |
| `/handover` | Generate vacation handover docs in seconds |
| `/research` | Multi-source research synthesis with confidence scoring |
| `/consensus` | Build stakeholder alignment systematically |

## The Belief

> **The best PMs don't just write specs. They build prototypes, automate workflows, and speak fluent engineering. With AI, every PM can.**

This isn't about replacing engineering. It's about PMs having superpowers:
- **Prototype ideas** before asking for engineering time
- **Automate repetitive PM work** (PRDs, retros, handovers)
- **Speak the language** of systems, APIs, and architecture
- **Build tools** that solve your own problems

## The Vision

I'm building toward a future where:

1. **"Technical PM" is the default**, not the exception
2. **AI augments product thinking**, not just code generation
3. **PMs ship tools**, not just documents

PM-Kit is my first step. It's open source because I want others to build on it, improve it, and prove that this future is possible.

## Try It

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugin install kv0906/pm-kit

# Then try
/pm          # Get help choosing a command
/prd         # Generate a PRD
/northstar   # Define your product vision
```

## Join The Movement

If you're a PM exploring AI tools, I'd love to connect:

- **Try PM-Kit** and tell me what's missing
- **Star the repo** if it's useful
- **DM me** with your PM + AI experiments

The gap between "PM" and "Technical PM" is closing. Let's close it together.
